# Football History
This is a web application built using React with a C# api and backend SQL Server database. The application can be found here: https://footballhistoryui.azurewebsites.net/.

Currently there are 2 pages in the application:

#### League Seasons
Specific seasons can be selected from 1992/93 through to 2017/18 for any of the top 4 divisions in English League football. This page shows the final league table, all the results (including playoffs where relevant) as well as specific detail for individual teams such as their form over the season.

#### Clubs
Individual clubs can be selected (any that have appeared in one of the top 4 divisions of the English League since 1992/93) and metrics such as their final league positions each season will be shown.

# TODO
- Extend the available data back to 1888/89
- Add more metrics and pages
- Add ability to download result data
